# BiharmonicNavier
A $C^0$ finite element method for the biharmonic problem with Navier boundary conditions in a polygonal domain.

This code shows the example in [1].

The current code only shows the case with an L-shaped domain, if you need to calculate more complicated cases in your research or more assistance is need, please reach out to PeimengYin@gmail.com
